# Car Data Search and Viewer

**Author**: Jiawei He

## Project Overview

In this assignment, you have been provided with a `car-data.js` file containing an array of 220 car objects. Each car object in the array has the following properties: `id`, `carMake`, `carModel`, `carYear`, `country`, `price`, and `odometer`.

Your task is to develop a web application that allows users to search for and view specific information from the car data within the web browser. The server-side design should enable requests for car data based on each of the seven properties through separate URL paths.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Start the server by running `npm start` in the project directory.
5. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Functionality

The application provides the following functionality:

- Searching for cars based on each property (id, carMake, carModel, carYear, country, price, and odometer) through separate URL paths.
- Displaying search results in an organized and user-friendly manner.
- Allowing users to view detailed information about each car.

## Technologies Used

The project incorporates the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing and requests.
- Handlebars: A templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML templates.
- JSON: A lightweight data interchange format used for storing and retrieving car data.
- Fetch API: A JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests to retrieve car data from the server.
